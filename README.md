# Google-Business-Intelligence-Project-Google-Fiber

Welcome to Google Fiber! 
You are interviewing for a job with Google Fiber, which provides people and businesses with fiber optic internet. As part of the interview process, the Fiber customer service team has asked you to design a dashboard using fictional data. The position you are interviewing for is in the customer call center, where Fiber uses business intelligence to monitor and improve customer satisfaction.

To provide the interviewers with both BI value and organizational data maturity, you will use your knowledge of the BI stages: capture, analyze, and monitor. By the time you are done, you will have an end-of-course project that demonstrates your knowledge and skills to potential employers.

Your meeting notes
You are interviewing with the Google Fiber customer service team for a position as a BI analyst. At the end of the first interview, you spoke with the BI team and hiring manager to gather details about this project. Following are your notes from the meeting. Use the information they contain to complete the Stakeholder Requirements Document, Project Requirements Document, and Planning Document. For additional guidance, refer to the previous reading about key BI documents and the self-review about completing the documents.

Project background:

The team needs to understand how often customers again phone customer support after their first inquiry; this will help leaders understand whether the team is able to answer customer questions the first time. Further, leaders want to explore trends in repeat calls to identify why customers are having to call more than once, as well as how to improve the overall customer experience. I will create a dashboard to reveal insights about repeat callers. 

This fictional dataset is a version of actual data the team works with. Because of this, the data is already anonymized and approved. It includes:

- Number of calls
- Number of repeat calls after first contact
- Call type
- Market city
- Date

Stakeholders: 
- Emma Santiago, Hiring Manager
- Keith Portone, Project Manager
- Minna Rah, Lead BI Analyst

Team members: 
- Ian Ortega, BI Analyst
- Sylvie Essa, BI Analyst

*Primary contacts are Emma and Keith

Per Minna: Dashboard needs to be accessible, with large print and text-to-speech alternatives.

Project approvals and dependencies: I need to make sure stakeholders have access to all datasets so they can explore the steps I’ve taken.

Project goal: Explore trends in repeat callers

Details from Mr. Portone:
- Understand how often customers are calling customer support after their first inquiry; this will help leaders understand how effectively the team is able to answer customer questions the first time
- Provide insights into the types of customer issues that seem to generate more repeat calls
- Explore repeat caller trends in the three different market cities
- Design charts so that stakeholders can view trends by week, month, quarter, and year. 

The deliverables and metrics:

- A chart or table measuring repeat calls by their first contact date
- A chart or table exploring repeat calls by market and problem type
- Charts showcasing repeat calls by week, month, and quarter

Measure success:

The team’s ultimate goal is to reduce call volume by increasing customer satisfaction and improving operational optimization. My dashboard should demonstrate an understanding of this goal and provide stakeholders with insights about repeat caller volumes in different markets and the types of problems they represent. 

Other considerations:

In order to anonymize and fictionalize the data, the datasets the columns market_1, market_2, and market_3 to indicate three different city service areas the data represents. 

The data also lists five problem types:
- Type_1 is account management
- Type_2 is technician troubleshooting
- Type_3 is scheduling
- Type_4 is construction
- Type_5 is internet and wifi

Additionally, the dataset records repeat calls over seven-day periods. The initial contact date is listed as contacts_n. The other call columns are then contacts_n_number of days since first call. For example, contacts_n_6 indicates six days since first contact. 

People with dashboard-viewing privileges: Emma Santiago, Keith Portone, Minna Rah, Ian Ortega, Sylvie Essa

Questions:

- How often does the customer service team receive repeat calls from customers?
- What problem types generate the most repeat calls?
- Which market city’s customer service team receives the most repeat calls?

Next steps

As you use these notes to complete the key BI documents, take time to consider:

- How to organize the various points and steps
- How to group similar topics
- Whether the information is relevant to the project
- Whether the metrics are effective

Lastly, keep in mind that this project is not graded. However, a compelling project will enable you to demonstrate fundamental BI skills to prospective employers. After you complete the documents, be sure to compare them to the example deliverables. You might also record the steps you took to complete each phase of this project so that you can complete the executive summary. This will be important as you continue working on the project in subsequent courses.
